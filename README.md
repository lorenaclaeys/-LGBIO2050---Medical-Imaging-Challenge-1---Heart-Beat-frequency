 Context and objective 
>Along with a good soft tissue contrast, the MRI imaging modality presents the advantage of not giving any imaging
irradiation dose to the patient during the acquisition. It allows to acquire images continuously to observe high
frequency anatomical motions such as breathing, or even faster motion such as coughing or the patient heartbeat.
For this challenge, a 2D dynamic MRI sequence at 20 frames per second is available. The goal is to implement a method
using Fourier transforms to determine the heartbeat frequency of the patient in beats/minute. You will be evaluated
on the robustness of your method and on the heartbeat frequency you find.
